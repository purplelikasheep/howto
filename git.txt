1) How do you merge selective files with git-merge?

Lets say you have the master, exp1, and exp2 branches. You want to merge one file from each of the experimental branches into master. I would do something like this:

git checkout master
git checkout exp1 path/to/file_a
git checkout exp2 path/to/file_b

# save these files as a stash
git stash
# merge stash with master
git merge stash

2) How to remove files from git staging area?

You can unstage files from the index using

git reset HEAD -- path/to/file

Just like git add, you can unstage files recursively by directory and so forth, so to unstage everything at once, run this from the root directory of your repository:

git reset HEAD -- .

Also, for future reference, the output of git status will tell you the commands you need to run to move files from one state to another.

6) Rename branch

git branch -m old_branch new_branch         # Rename branch locally    

git push origin :old_branch                 # Delete the old branch    

git push --set-upstream origin new_branch   # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote
