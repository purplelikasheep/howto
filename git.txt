1) How do you merge selective files with git-merge?

Lets say you have the master, exp1, and exp2 branches. You want to merge one file from each of the experimental branches into master. I would do something like this:

git checkout master
git checkout exp1 path/to/file_a
git checkout exp2 path/to/file_b

# save these files as a stash
git stash
# merge stash with master
git merge stash

2) How to remove files from git staging area?

You can unstage files from the index using

git reset HEAD -- path/to/file

Just like git add, you can unstage files recursively by directory and so forth, so to unstage everything at once, run this from the root directory of your repository:

git reset HEAD -- .

Also, for future reference, the output of git status will tell you the commands you need to run to move files from one state to another.

5) How to fetch all branches

git fetch --all

git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | while read remote; do git branch --track "${remote#origin/}" "$remote"; done
git fetch --all
git pull --all

6) Rename branch

git branch -m old_branch new_branch         # Rename branch locally    

git push origin :old_branch                 # Delete the old branch    

git push --set-upstream origin new_branch   # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote

7) Change remote directory

7) How do I delete a Git branch both locally and remotely?

Executive Summary

$ git push -d <remote_name> <branch_name>
$ git branch -d <branch_name>

Note that in most cases the remote name is origin.
Delete Local Branch

To delete the local branch use one of the following:

$ git branch -d branch_name
$ git branch -D branch_name

Note: The -d option is an alias for --delete, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch. You could also use -D, which is an alias for --delete --force, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status." [Source: man git-branch]

8)change commit mesage 


On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend.
Type git commit --amend and press Enter.
In your text editor, edit the commit message and save the commit. You can also add a co-author by adding a trailer to the commit. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple authors."
Use the push --force command to force push over the old commit.
